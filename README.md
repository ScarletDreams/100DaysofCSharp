# 100DaysofCSharp
My journey with the 100daysofcode challenge for C#!

I really wanted to hold myself accountable and decided to tackle this challenge for a language I was interested in learning. 
I went into this knowing the basics, so I plan to tackle my weak points and move on from there. 
By the end of this challenge, I want to be able to build and deploy my own app!
